## Details

### Lists Assignment

1. Create a new directory named ***links-and-images***
2. Within that directory, create a new file named ***index.html***
3. Fill in the usual ***HTML boilerplate***
4. Set the title to ***“Links & Images”***
5. Finally, add the following **h1** to the body: **\<h1>** Homepage **\</h1>**
6. Create another HTML file named **about.html**
7. Back in the index page, add the following anchor element below the **h1**
element:  
\<a href=”https://theuselessweb.com/”>click me</a>  
\<a href="about.html">About</a>
8. Open the index file in a browser and click on the **About** link to make sure it is all wired together correctly. Clicking the link should go to the empty about page you just created (you can fill it in if you like)
9. Create a directory named ***pages*** within the **links-and-images** directory and move the **about.html** file into this new directory.
10. You can also add a link to get back from the **About** page to your homepage
11. To use images on your own websites, you can use a relative path:  
    i. Create a new directory named ***images*** within the **links-and-images** project  
    ii. Next, download any image **.jpg/.png** and move it into the images directory you just created.  
    iii. Rename the image to ***first-img.jpg/.png***  
    iv. Add the image to the index.html file:  
        **\<img src="images/first-img.jpg">**  
    v. Save the index.html file and open it in a browser to view your image in all its glory.
12. As a bit of practice, add an alt attribute to the first-img you added to the links-and-images project.
